React router dom--->  It enables routing in react-dom
routing means if we created a app on localhost//:3000 and we divided the compoents int 3 type one is home,about and movies

if we want to go to each one separately then we just have to do
         localhost//:3000/about--------> by this we can switched to about page 

         localhost//:3000/movies-------> by this we can switched to movies page

         localhost//:3000/home--------> by this we  can switched to home page
